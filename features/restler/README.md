### *Expected features* for Restler Framework

For Behavior Driven Development (BDD) we are using Behat to write down the
features and test them against the API

To run the restler framework tests against examples (`public/examples`), run
the following using the terminal from the project root
(where the vendor folder resides)

    bin/behat features/restler

> **Note:-** This requires the dependecies for restler framework to be
> installed first
