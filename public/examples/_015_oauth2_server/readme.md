## OAuth2 Server 

 This example requires `PHP >= 5.3.9` and taggeed under `access-control` `acl` `secure` `authentication` `authorization`


### Setting up the server example

In order to run this example on your localhost do the following

1. run composer update to make sure you have
    - twig template library
    - bshaffer's oauth2 libaray
2. make sure `public/examples/_015_oauth2_server/cache` has write permissions to create the compiled template files
3. make sure `public/examples/_015_oauth2_server/Auth/db` has write permission, this is where `oauth.sqlite` file be
   created at run time

Now that you are ready, lets look at the example

![OAuth 2 Client](../resources/OAuth2Server.png)

To look at the server start from the client app [here](../_014_oauth2_client)

> This API Server is made using the following php files/folders
> 
> * index.php      (gateway)
> * Server.php      (auth)
> * restler.php      (framework)
> * JsonFormat.php      (format)

This API Server exposes the following URIs

    GET  access    ⇠ Auth\Server::access()
    POST authorize ⇠ Auth\Server::postAuthorize()
    GET  authorize ⇠ Auth\Server::authorize()
    POST grant     ⇠ Auth\Server::postGrant()


This example is part 2 in a 2 part example that shows how Restler can
be integrated with the popular [OAuth 2.0 Server ](http://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/)
library. This section -- the "server" -- focuses on enabling a Restler server to play the role of an
OAuth authorization and authentication server.

If you're not familiar with OAuth, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the
basics and in particular understanding the various workflow that OAuth 2.0 offers.
The following two links may help:

- [Official OAuth Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2):
a bit dry but if you want the "facts" they're there.
- [OAuth2 Simplified](http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified):
a nicely summarized overview of how to think through the key aspects of OAuth 2.0

The role of the `server application` in OAuth is:

1. **Authorization**: providing an authorization screen to the user with a set of permissions listed along with an "allow"
button to allow the user to grant the client application these permissions.
2. **Authentication**: validating the authorization information sent by the client application and then passing along the
entitlements granted onto the Restler iAuthenticate system

It's important to understand that the *workflow* of asking for access varies by "grant type" in OAuth.
The standard grant-types that OAuth 2.0 Server  supports out-of-the-box are:

- **Implicit**: typically for browser based or mobile apps
- **Authorization Code**: typically for apps running on a server
- **Password Credentials**: typically used for apps that are owned by the same organisation as the OAuth service
  provider (aka, the Twitter client, etc.)
- **Client Credentials**: used by client's who want to update meta information about their site (URL's, logo's, etc.)
- **JWT Auth Grant**: the client submits a *JSON Web Token* in a request to the token endpoint. An access token
  (without a refresh token) is then returned directly.
- **Refresh Token**: client can submit refresh token and receive a new access token

### Storage ###
The first thing you will need to consider when setting up the server is what database technology you'd like to use to
manage state. In this example the storage is managed in a local SQLite database but examples are given for mySQL,
Mongo DB, Doctrine, and several other storage technologies. If there isn't an example template available then simply
find the one that most closely resembles your technology (e.g., couchbase is similar to mongo, etc.) and spend the time
to understand the required interfaces for a storage class. Creating your own storage object is relatively easy
so don't use the lack of a pre-existing template as an excuse not move forward.

Once your storage object is ready to go just include it in the Server.php's constructor.

### Grant Types ###
Grant types are configured in the Server.php file as well. In 99% of cases you'll use the built-in grant types. In these
cases it's just a matter of adding one (or more) grant types in the constructor:

```php
static::$server->addGrantType(
    new OAuth2\GrantType\AuthorizationCode(static::$storage)
);
```

Creating your own grant types is an advanced topic and will not be covered here but if you feel this is required for
your project then reference the *Extension Grants* section in the [OAuth2 Server's documentation](http://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/overview/grant-types/).

### Scope / Permissions ###
The term "scope" in OAuth refers to the *amount* of *things* your authorization will allow a client application to do.
Some API's simply have a single scope for all client application but even in this case it's important to clearly clarify
to the user what things the requesting client application will be able to do once the "approve button" has been pressed.
In more complicated situations *scope* can be broken down into different *roles*.
This granularity in terms of modifying "the ask" is great way to dramatically increase client's willingness to grant
permissions.

To configure scope you will need to implement the `OAuth2\Storage\ScopeInterface` interface. More documentation can be
found here:
[scope](http://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/overview/scope/).

## Workflow ##
Now that your `OAuth server` is setup, it will now manage both `authorization` requests as well as validate
`authentication` credentials. The two flows are illustrated below:

[![Authorization Code Flow](../resources/auth-code-workflow-thumb.png)](../resources/auth-code-workflow.png)

### Authorization ###

The specific flow for authorization will be dependant on the grant-type but in this documentation we will stick to
describing the "authorization code" grant-type as this what the example app uses. The first step in this process is
serving up authorization page to the user. This takes advantage of Restler's built-in support for custom views which
includes twig templating and only requires that you point the API to a Twig template file. For example:

    @format HtmlFormat
    @view oauth2/server/authorize.twig

The @view and @format comments above the `authorize` method will serve the date through right template(view) file out to
the user. Following a user granting authorization, the server will use the client application's *callback* function to
pass back an access token.

### Authentication ###
For any Restler resources which require authentication, the OAuth server will use the 'code' *query parameter* and
compare that to it's internal records to validate that the user has the appropriate permissions.

> **Note:-**
> there is an optional parameter on the server that allows the Access Token to be passed as a header variable instead of
> a query parameter.

## In Conclusion ##
Many people are experientially familiar with OAuth clients either as a user who has granted apps permissions or
as a developer who has downloaded one of many OAuth clients to get at social data from sources like Twitter, Facebook,
Foursquare, etc. The server side of the interaction is less familiar yet it needs to be the primary focus for any
RESTful API that imagines itself as having data of which other applications would benefit from having access to your
data. Brett Shaffers's [OAuth2 Server ](http://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/) solution focuses on the
server side of the interaction but provides both client and server components and both are now readily available to
Restler customers who want to offer or connect-into the world of OAuth2.
